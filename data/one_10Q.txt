            Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

                                 (unaudited)

                                    1.
   Nature of Business and Organization
   Higher One Holdings, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware and provides a
   comprehensive suite of disbursement and payment solutions specifically
   designed for higher education institutions and their students. We have
   developed proprietary software-based solutions to provide these
   services.  We have one wholly-owned subsidiary, Higher One, Inc., or
   HOI, which has three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Higher One Machines,
   Inc., or HOMI; Higher One Payments, Inc., or HOPI; and Higher One Real
   Estate, Inc., or Real Estate Inc. Real Estate Inc has one wholly-owned
   subsidiary, Higher One Real Estate SP, LLC, or Real Estate LLC. HOMI
   owns and manages our cash disbursement machines and home-based customer
   service agent services. HOPI is the acquired entity formerly known as
   Informed Decisions Corporation that provides payment solutions and
   services. Real Estate Inc and Real Estate LLC were formed for purposes
   related to our real estate development project discussed in Note 4.
                                2.
   Significant Accounting Policies
   Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
   and the related interim information contained within the notes to such
   condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
   accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America, or GAAP, and the applicable rules of the Securities
   and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for interim information and quarterly
   reports on Form 10-Q.
   The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
   prepared on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial
   statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year
   ended December 31, 2010 and in the opinion of management include all
   normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for the fair statement
   of our interim period results reported herein.  The December 31, 2010
   condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited
   financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by
   GAAP.  Due to seasonal fluctuations and other factors, the results of
   operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2011 are
   not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
   year.
   The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the
   financial position and results of operations of us and our wholly-owned
   subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have
   been eliminated in consolidation.
   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
   requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that
   affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
   contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
   reporting periods. Actual results could differ from management's
   estimates.
   Basic and Diluted Net Income Available to Common Stockholders per
   Common Share
   As discussed in Note 6 below, on June 22, 2010, we consummated an
   initial public offering of common stock. Had we made a distribution to
   stockholders prior to the initial public offering, all classes of
   preferred stock would have participated pro rata in dividends if and
   when we declared a dividend. Therefore, the two class method of
   calculating basic net income per common share was applied for the three
   months and six months ended June 30, 2010. Upon completion of the
   initial public offering, all classes of preferred stock converted to
   common shares. As a result, the two class method does not apply to the
   three months and six months ended June 30, 2011.

                                 (unaudited)

   Basic net income per common share excludes dilution for potential
   common stock issuances and is computed by dividing net income available
   to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
   outstanding for the period.  Diluted net income per common share
   reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
   contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
   stock.  For the calculation of diluted net income per common share, the
   basic weighted-average number of shares is increased by the dilutive
   effect of restricted stock and stock options using the treasury-stock
   method.  The treasury-stock method assumes that the options or warrants
   are exercised at the beginning of the year (or date of issue if later),
   and that the company uses those proceeds to purchase common stock for
   the treasury at the average price for the reporting period.
   The dilutive effect of stock options totaling 933,750 and 1,040,302
   were not included in the computation of diluted net income per common
   share for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2011, respectively,
   as their effect would be anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of stock
   options totaling 933,750 and 1,031,352 were not included in the
   computation of diluted net income per common share for the six months
   ended June 30, 2010 and 2011, respectively, as their effect would be
   anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive securities are securities that upon
   conversion or exercise increase earnings per share (or reduce the loss
   per share). Restricted stock shares totaling 1,885,626 and 1,276,800
   were not included in the computation of either basic or diluted
   earnings per share as all necessary conditions for vesting have not
   been satisfied by the end of the three and six months ended June 30,
   2010 and 2011, respectively.
   Comprehensive Income
   There are no comprehensive income items other than net income. There
   are no recorded unrealized gains or losses on the investments in
   marketable securities as of the balance sheet dates.  Comprehensive
   income equals net income for all periods presented.
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Standards Implemented
   We adopted each of the following standards on January 1, 2011.  The
   adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our
   results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  There was no
   material impact to our units of accounting, the way in which we
   allocate consideration to various units of accounting or changes in the
   pattern or timing of revenue recognition.
   In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
   issued Accounting Standards Update , or ASU, No. 2009-13
   "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements." This ASU establishes the
   accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple
   revenue-generating activities. This ASU provides amendments to the
   criteria for separating deliverables, measuring and allocating
   arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The
   amendments in this ASU also establish a selling price hierarchy for
   determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced
   disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor's
   multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about
   the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance
   within arrangements. The amendments also require providing information
   about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and
   about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects
   the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The amendments in this ASU
   are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
   materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15,
   2010.

   In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, "Certain Revenue
   Arrangements That Include Software Elements." This ASU changes the
   accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible
   products and software elements that are essential to the functionality
   of the product, and scopes these products out of current software
   revenue guidance. The new guidance includes factors to help companies
   determine what software elements are considered essential to the
   functionality of the product. The amendments subject software-enabled
   products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as
   guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple-deliverables.
   The amendments in this ASU are effective prospectively for revenue
   arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years
   beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
   In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, "Milestone Method of
   Revenue Recognition," which indicates the criteria that should be met
   for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is
   appropriate. Companies can recognize consideration that is contingent
   upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the
   period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets
   all criteria to be considered substantive. This ASU is effective for
   fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements - New Standards to be Implemented
   In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income
   (Topic 220)--Presentation of Comprehensive Income," which requires an
   entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of
   net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in
   a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two
   separate but consecutive statements. This accounting standard update
   eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive
   income as part of the statement of equity and is effective for fiscal
   years beginning after December 15, 2011.  This accounting standard
   update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated
   financial statements.
   In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve
   Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
   and International Financial Reporting Standards," which provides a
   consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value
   measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP
   and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes
   certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure
   requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU
   2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
   December 15, 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting
   ASU 2011-04, but believe there will be no significant impact on our
   consolidated financial statements.
   In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to clarify the
   acquisition date that should be used for reporting pro-forma financial
   information for business combinations. If comparative financial
   statements are presented, the pro-forma revenue and earnings of the
   combined entity for the comparable prior reporting period should be
   reported as though the acquisition date for all business combinations
   that occurred during the current year had been completed as of the
   beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The
   amendments in this guidance are effective prospectively for business
   combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1,
   2011. There will be no impact on our consolidated financial results as
   the amendments relate only to additional disclosures.
   In December 2010, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on
   goodwill impairment testing. The amendments modify Step 1 of the
   goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative
   carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to
   perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely
   than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In making such a
   determination, the guidance states that an entity should consider
   whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an
   impairment may exist. The amendments are effective for fiscal years and
   interim periods beginning January 1, 2011 and are not expected to have
   a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

   Investments in Marketable Securities and Fair Value Measurements
   As of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, all of our investments in
   marketable securities were classified as available for sale.  Amortized
   cost basis was equal to aggregate fair value for each of the major
   security types as reflected in the table below. We had no recorded
   unrealized gains or losses from investments as of December 31, 2010 and
   June 30, 2011.  The contractual maturities of our available for sale
   securities ranged from one to fifteen months as of June 30, 2011.
   All of our assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis
   are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
   assets (Level 1).  We do not have any liabilities carried at fair value
   as of either June 30, 2011 or December 31, 2010. The following table
   provides the assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis
   as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 (in thousands of dollars):

   Real Estate Development Project
   As of June 30, 2011, we have incurred approximately $10.9 million on a
   project to develop two existing commercial buildings located in New
   Haven, Connecticut.  We will move into these buildings at the
   completion of the project in 2012.  In connection with the real estate
   development project, HOI and Real Estate LLC entered into an agreement
   with the Connecticut Development Authority which provides for sales and
   use tax relief for property purchases made for the project.  The total
   amount of potential sales and use tax relief is $1 million.  The
   conditions of the sales and use tax agreement require repayment to the
   Connecticut Development Authority of the actual amount of sales and use
   tax savings plus an additional 7.5% if HOI fails to meet certain
   criteria.  In accordance with this obligation, we deposited $1.1
   million into an escrow account in February 2011, which is reflected on
   the condensed consolidated balance sheet as noncurrent restricted cash.
                5.
   Credit Facility
   On December 31, 2010, HOI entered into a senior secured revolving
   credit facility, or the Credit Facility. The amount available to be
   drawn under the Credit Facility may be increased by an additional $50.0
   million upon our request and the agreement of the lenders party to the
   Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Facility provides for letters
   of credit of up to $3 million and includes certain restrictions on the
   amount of acquisitions we may complete. As of June 30, 2011, $50.0
   million in borrowings were available to us under the Credit Facility
   and we were in compliance with all of the applicable affirmative,
   negative and financial covenants in the Credit Facility.

              6.
   Capital Stock
   Initial Public Offering
   On June 22, 2010, we consummated an initial public offering of
   3,569,395 shares of newly issued common stock and 6,780,605 shares
   offered by selling stockholders. The aggregate public offering price of
   the offering amount registered was $124.2 million and the offering did
   not terminate before all of the shares registered in the registration
   statement were sold. Our proceeds of $37.2 million, net of issuance
   costs, were used to pay outstanding amounts on our credit facility in
   effect at that time, make an escrow payment of $8.25 million related to
   the acquisition payable described in Note 7 below and fund working
   capital. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares
   by the selling stockholders.
   Upon consummation of our initial public offering, 417,049 shares of
   Series A convertible preferred stock outstanding, 1,086,784 shares of
   Series B convertible preferred stock outstanding, 2,522,554 shares of
   Series C convertible preferred stock outstanding, 2,180,633 shares of
   Series C-1 convertible preferred stock outstanding, 1,313,604 shares of
   Series D convertible preferred stock outstanding and 5,454,545 shares
   of Series E convertible preferred stock outstanding were converted into
   38,925,507 shares of common stock after giving effect to the 3-for-1
   stock split discussed below. Following the consummation of the
   offering, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
   Common Stock
   In connection with the initial public offering, we effected a 3-for-1
   stock split of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock that was
   previously approved by stockholders. All common share amounts and per
   common share amounts have been adjusted in the financial statements for
   all periods presented. We are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000
   shares of Common Stock with a par value of $.001 per share. Each share
   of Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters
   submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Common stockholders are not
   entitled to receive dividends unless declared by the Board of
   Directors.
   Preferred Stock
   We are authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with a
   par value of $.001 per share.  As of December 31, 2010 and June 30,
   2011, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.
                              7.
   Commitments and Contingencies
   From time to time we are subject to litigation relating to matters in
   the ordinary course of business, as well as regulatory examinations,
   information gathering requests, inquiries and investigations. In
   February 2011, the New York Regional Office of the Federal Deposit
   Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, notified us that it was prepared to
   recommend to the Director of FDIC Supervision that an enforcement
   action be taken against us for alleged violations of certain applicable
   laws and regulations principally relating to our compliance management
   system and policies and practices for past overdraft charging on
   persistently delinquent accounts, collections and transaction error
   resolution. Any such enforcement action could result in an order to pay
   restitution and civil money penalties. We have responded to the FDIC's
   notification and have amended certain practices. In view of the
   inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of regulatory matters,
   including the FDIC notification, we generally cannot predict what the
   eventual outcome of pending matters will be or what the timing of the
   ultimate resolution of these matters will be.  However, we currently
   estimate the potential range of loss associated with these matters to
   be between $0 and $10 million. In accordance with applicable accounting
   guidance, we would establish a liability for litigation and regulatory
   matters if and when those matters were to present loss contingencies
   that were both probable and reasonably estimable.

   On June 22, 2010, HOI provided notice and a certificate of claim for
   indemnity under the Stock Purchase Agreement by and among us and the
   former stockholders of Informed Decisions Corporation, or IDC, dated
   November 19, 2009, arising from certain misrepresentations and breaches
   of warranty. At the same time, we deposited $8.25 million, equal to the
   remaining balance of the post-closing payments, with an escrow
   agent. Separately, the former stockholders of IDC filed a complaint
   against HOI in the United States District Court for the Northern
   District of California, or the Complaint, on July 20, 2010, disputing
   that misrepresentations were made and that warranties were breached;
   alleging breach of contract and anticipatory breach; and seeking a
   declaratory judgment ordering that the post-closing payments be made in
   accordance with the schedule set forth in the stock purchase agreement.
   On April 25, 2011, HOI and the former stockholders of IDC agreed to a
   settlement, the material terms of which are as follows: (a) $2 million
   of the amount held in escrow, plus pro-rated interest, was to be paid
   to HOI; (b) $6.25 million of the amount held in escrow, plus pro-rated
   interest, was to be paid to the former stockholders; and (c) HOI and
   the former stockholders generally and mutually released each other from
   all past and future claims, known and unknown, arising out of the stock
   purchase agreement and related transition services agreements between
   HOI and each of the former stockholders, relating to the operation or
   sale of IDC, including all indemnification and payment obligations,
   with the exception of certain rights, obligations and claims.  The
   amount held in escrow was distributed to HOI and the former
   stockholders of IDC in accordance with the terms of the settlement
   agreement in May 2011.
   We recorded the impact of the settlement agreement in the quarter
   ending June 30, 2011.  The $2 million returned from escrow to us was
   recorded as other income of $1.5 million, reflecting a payment made
   under the indemnification provisions of the stock purchase agreement
   and a reduction of general and administrative expenses of $0.5 million,
   reflecting the recovery of certain legal costs incurred for the
   litigation.
   In February 2009 and September 2010, HOI filed two separate complaints
   against TouchNet Information Systems, Inc., or TouchNet, in the United
   States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging patent
   infringement related to TouchNet's offering for sale and sales of its
   "eRefund" product in violation of one of two of HOI's patents. In the
   complaints, HOI sought judgments that TouchNet has infringed two of
   HOI's patents, a judgment that TouchNet pay damages and interest on
   damages to compensate HOI for infringement, an award of HOI's costs in
   connection with these actions and an injunction barring TouchNet from
   further infringing HOI's patent. TouchNet answered the complaint and
   asserted a number of defenses and counterclaims, including that it does
   not infringe HOI's patent, that HOI's patent is invalid or
   unenforceable and certain allegations of unfair competition and state
   and federal antitrust violations. In addition, TouchNet's counterclaims
   sought dismissal of HOI's claims with prejudice, declaratory judgment
   that TouchNet does not infringe HOI's patent and that HOI's patent is
   invalid or unenforceable, as well as an award of fees and costs related
   to the action, and an injunction permanently enjoining HOI from suing
   TouchNet regarding infringement of HOI's patent. The parties are
   currently in the discovery stage of the proceeding. HOI intends to
   pursue the matter vigorously. There can be no assurances of success in
   these proceedings.

   Item 2.                                Management's Discussion and
   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
   The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction
   with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as
   included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
   31, 2010 and information contained elsewhere in such annual report on
   Form 10-K and in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The discussion
   contains forward-looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and
   assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from
   expectations. Factors that might cause these differences include those
   described under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the annual report on
   Form 10-K and in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The
   forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form
   10-Q are made only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake
   any obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking statements
   to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by
   law. We cannot assure you that projected results or events will be
   achieved or will occur.

                                  Overview

   We believe that based on market share and the number of campuses
   employing our products, we are a leading provider of technology and
   payment services to the higher education industry. We believe that none
   of our competitors can match our ability to provide solutions for
   higher education institutions' financial services needs, including
   compliance monitoring, and, consequently, that we provide the most
   comprehensive suite of disbursement and payment solutions specifically
   designed for higher education institutions and their students. We also
   provide campus communities with convenient, cost-competitive and
   student-oriented banking services, which include extensive
   user-friendly features.
   Our products and services for our higher education institutional
   clients include our OneDisburse® Refund Management® disbursement
   service and our CASHNet® suite of payment transaction products and
   services. Through our bank partner, we offer our OneAccount service to
   the students of our higher education institutional clients, which
   includes an FDIC-insured deposit account, a OneCard, which is a debit
   MasterCard® ATM card, and other retail banking services.
   As of June 30, 2011, more than 490 campuses serving approximately
   3.7 million students had purchased the OneDisburse® funds disbursement
   service.  This represents an increase of 246 thousand students, or
   7.2%, from the level as of March 31, 2011 and 378 thousand students, or
   11.5%, from December 31, 2010.  As of June 30, 2011, more than 350
   campuses serving approximately 2.6 million students had contracted to
   use one or more of our CASHNet® payment products and services. As of
   June 30, 2011, there were approximately 1.7 million OneAccounts.  Since
   the initial launch of our OneDisburse® funds disbursement service in
   2002 and as of June 30, 2011, we have completed disbursement
   transactions with a total cash value of over $23 billion.
   Our revenue fluctuates as a result of seasonal factors related to the
   academic year. A large proportion of our revenue is either directly or
   indirectly dependent on academic financial aid received by students.
   Higher education institutional clients typically disburse financial aid
   refunds to students at the start of each academic term. Distribution of
   financial aid disbursements through our OneDisburse® service (1)
   indirectly generates revenue through deposits of financial aid into
   OneAccounts, which generates account revenue, and (2) directly
   generates revenue through our higher education institution clients' use
   of the OneDisburse® service, which generates higher education
   institution revenue.
   While revenue fluctuates over the course of the year, our fixed
   expenses remain relatively constant, resulting in wide disparities in
   our net income and adjusted net income from quarter to quarter.
   Typically, the first and third quarters account for the largest
   proportion of our revenues but an equal proportion of certain of our
   expenses. This is primarily because the majority of financial aid is
   disbursed during these times of the year and higher education
   institutions tend to enroll more new students in the third fiscal
   quarter. We expect that this trend will continue going forward.

   We continue to assess the impact of certain legislative and regulatory
   changes that have been enacted or made effective that may impact our
   operations and revenue. Effective July 1, 2010, the Federal Reserve
   Board amended its regulations implementing the Electronic Funds
   Transfer Act, or Regulation E, to limit the ability of financial
   institutions to assess overdraft fees for paying ATM and one-time debit
   card transactions that overdraw a consumer's account, unless the
   consumer affirmatively consents, or opts in, to the institution's
   payments of overdrafts for these services. On July 21, 2010, the
   Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Act,
   was signed into law. The Act will change many banking practices over
   time, however, the scope and impact of many of the Act's provisions are
   still being defined through the rule making process. On June 29, 2011,
   the Federal Reserve issued its final rule implementing the limits on
   debit card interchange fees and requirements for future routing of
   transactions required by the Act.  In accordance with the Act, issuers
   that, together with their affiliates, have less than $10 billion in
   assets are exempt from these debit card interchange fee limits,
   although they are subject to the prohibitions on network exclusivity
   and routing restrictions.  Our banking partner, The Bancorp Bank, has
   assets of less than $10 billion and therefore should be exempt from the
   debit card interchange fee cap.  While we currently do not expect the
   limitation on debit card interchange fees or the provisions relating to
   network exclusivity and routing restrictions to have a material result
   on our results of operations, we will continue to evaluate the Act, the
   ongoing rule making process and their effect on our business and
   results of operations.  See "Risk Factors."

   Three Months Ended June 30, 2011 Compared to the Three Months Ended
   June 30, 2010
   Revenue
   Account revenue
   The increase in account revenue was primarily due to an increase of
   39.5%, or 0.5 million, in the number of OneAccounts from June 30, 2010
   to June 30, 2011.  Greater adoption and student enrollments at higher
   education institutions which were clients as of June 30, 2010 accounted
   for 58% of the increase in the number of OneAccounts.  The remaining
   increase was due to students choosing the OneAccount at higher
   education institutions which became clients after June 30, 2010.  The
   increase in the number of OneAccounts resulted in increases in
   interchange fees, ATM fees and other fees that our bank partner remits
   to us. While our historical experience has been that account revenue
   generated per OneAccount has been generally stable year over year, with
   total account revenue generally increasing proportionally with
   increases in the number of OneAccounts, the implementation of
   amendments to Regulation E in the third quarter of 2010 decreased the
   account revenue per OneAccount compared to the same period in the prior
   year.  We expect the account revenue per OneAccount to continue to be
   lower than in previous periods as the result of insufficient funds fee
   changes made in response to the amendments to Regulation E through the
   third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 which
   resulted in reductions in insufficent fund fees.
   Payment Transaction Revenue
   The increase in payment transaction revenue was primarily due to an
   increase in the number of higher education institutions using our
   CASHNet® payment transaction product.



   -14-
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60]Table of Contents

   Higher Education Institution Revenue
   The increase in higher education institution revenue was primarily due
   to an increase in subscription revenues for our CASHNet® suite of
   payment products.  The increase in subscription revenue follows a
   consistent rate of revenue compared to the first quarter of 2011 and
   reflects amounts earned both on new modules sold to previously existing
   higher education institution clients, as well as sales of the CASHNet®
   suite of payment products to new higher education institution clients.
   Other Revenue
   The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to a decrease in
   processing fees that our bank partner paid to us, which resulted
   primarily from a decrease in prevailing interest rates in the second
   quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010, partially
   offset by an increase in aggregate OneAccount balances compared to the
   same period in 2010.
   Cost of Revenue
   The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in the
   number of active OneAccounts.  The increase in active OneAccounts
   contributed to increases in data processing expenses of $1.0 million,
   or 47.4%, customer service expenses of $0.5 million, or 61.0%, and
   network fees of $0.4 million or 35.6%.  Write-offs and the provision
   for uncollectible fees increased $1.0 million, or 42.0%.  We
   experienced an increase in transaction processing costs related to our
   CASHNet® payment transaction revenue of $0.3 million or 15.4%.
   General and Administrative Expense
   The increase in general and administrative expenses was driven
   primarily by an increase in cash-based employee compensation costs of
   $0.8 million, or 25.7%; an increase in depreciation and amortization of
   $0.3 million, or 33.1%; and losses on the disposal of ATMs of $0.1
   million associated with the replacement of a portion of our ATMs during
   the quarter ended June 30, 2011.  General and administrative expenses
   for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 reflects a reduction in expenses of
   $0.5 million due to the recovery of certain legal costs incurred for
   the litigation with the former stockholders of Informed Decisions
   Corporation, see Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings for additional
   information related to our settlement agreement.
   Product Development Expense
   The increase in product development expense was primarily due to
   increases in personnel costs.
   Sales and Marketing Expense
   The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to an
   increase of $1.2 million, or 39.9%, in non-cash, stock-based sales
   acquisition expense related to the vesting of certain shares issued in
   connection with the acquisition of EduCard, LLC due to both a higher
   average share price at the date of vesting as well as additional shares
   vesting.
   Interest Expense
   The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower
   amortization of deferred financing costs of the Credit Facility,
   compared to the credit facility in place during 2010 and the accretion
   of our acquisition payable during 2010 which became fully accreted
   throughout 2010 and no longer accrues interest.  During the three
   months ended June 30, 2011, a zero balance was maintained on the Credit
   Facility.

   Other Income
   We recorded $1.5 million of other income during the quarter ended June
   30, 2011 as a result of the settlement agreement reached with the
   former stockholders of IDC.  See Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings,
   for additional information related to our settlement agreement.
   Income Tax Expense
   The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase of
   $3.5 million, or 115.3%, of net income before taxes.  The gain we
   recorded as a result of the settlement agreement with the former
   stockholders of IDC of $1.5 million did not have any tax impact, which
   resulted in only a 46.6% increase in income tax expense for the quarter
   ending June 30, 2011.  The effective tax rates for the three months
   ended June 30, 2010 and 2011 were 39.3% and 26.7%, respectively.  Our
   effective rate is expected to be between 35% and 37% for the 2011
   fiscal year.

   Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 Compared to the Six Months Ended June
   30, 2010
   Revenue
   Account revenue
   The increase in account revenue was primarily due to an increase of
   39.5%, or 0.5 million, in the number of OneAccounts from June 30, 2010
   to June 30, 2011.  Greater adoption and student enrollments at higher
   education institutions which were clients as of June 30, 2010 accounted
   for 58% of the increase in the number of OneAccounts.  The remaining
   increase was due to students choosing the OneAccount at higher
   education institutions which became clients after June 30, 2010.  The
   increase in the number of OneAccounts resulted in increases in
   interchange fees, ATM fees and other fees that our bank partner remits
   to us. While our historical experience has been that account revenue
   generated per OneAccount has been generally stable year over year, with
   total account revenue generally increasing proportionally with
   increases in the number of OneAccounts, the implementation of
   amendments to Regulation E in the third quarter of 2010 decreased the
   account revenue per OneAccount compared to the same period in the prior
   year.  We expect the account revenue per OneAccount to continue to be
   lower than in previous periods as the result of insufficient funds fee
   changes made in response to the Regulation E amendments to regulations
   through the third quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011.
   Payment Transaction Revenue
   The increase in payment transaction revenue was primarily due to an
   increase in the number of higher education institutions using our
   CASHNet® payment transaction product.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [63]Table of Contents
   Higher Education Institution Revenue
   The increase in higher education institution revenue was primarily due
   to an increase in subscription revenues for our CASHNet® suite of
   payment products.  The increase in subscription revenue follows a
   consistent rate of revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 and
   reflects amounts earned both on new modules sold to previously existing
   higher education institution clients, as well as sales of the CASHNet®
   suite of payment products to new higher education institution clients.
   Cost of Revenue
   The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in the
   number of active OneAccounts.  The increase in the number of active
   OneAccounts contributed to increases in data processing expenses of
   $2.4 million, or 47.6%, customer service expenses of $1.4 million, or
   71.1%, and network fees of $1.1 million, or 33.1%.  Write-offs and the
   provision for uncollectible fees increased $2.6 million, or 55.3%,
   approximately $1.2 million of which related to losses associated with a
   theft at an unrelated third-party merchant.  While we experience these
   losses in the normal course of our business, it is unusual for us to
   experience a loss of this magnitude in a short period of time.  We also
   experienced an increase in transaction processing costs related to our
   CASHNet® payment transaction revenue of $0.7 million or 15.4%.
   General and Administrative Expense
   Although, general and administrative expenses continue to increase as
   our size grows, such expenses are increasing at a lower rate than our
   revenue growth.  The increase in general and administrative expenses
   was driven primarily by an increase of $1.0 million, or 13.5%, in
   cash-based employee compensation costs; $0.5 million, or 32.4%, in
   depreciation and amortization; $0.3 million, or 27.5%, in professional
   fees and $0.3 million, or 19.3% of stock-based compensation
   expense.  The remaining increases are varied expenses to support our
   business growth, including facility costs, costs to maintain our fleet
   of ATMs, telecommunications and other technology costs.
   Product Development Expense
   The decrease in product development expense was primarily due to
   decreases in costs related to outsourced services.
   Sales and Marketing Expense
   The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to an
   increase of $2.2 million, or 48.0%, in non-cash, stock-based sales
   acquisition expense related to the vesting of certain shares issued in
   connection with the acquisition of EduCard, LLC due to a higher average
   share price at the date of vesting as well as additional shares
   vesting.  Additional advertising expenses and tradeshow participation
   contributed to the overall increase.
   Interest Expense
   The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower
   amortization of deferred financing costs of the Credit Facility,
   compared to the credit facility in place during 2010 and the accretion
   of acquisition payable during 2010 which became fully accreted
   throughout 2010 and no longer accrues interest.  During the six months
   ended June 30, 2011, a zero balance was maintained on the Credit
   Facility.
   Other Income
   We recorded $1.5 million of other income during the six months ended
   June 30, 2011 as a result of the settlement agreement reached with the
   former stockholders of IDC.  See Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings,
   for additional information related to our settlement agreement.

   Income Tax Expense
   The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase of
   $7.9 million, or 48.2%, of net income before taxes.  The gain we
   recorded as a result of the settlement agreement with the former
   stockholders of IDC of $1.5 million did not have any tax impact, which
   resulted in only a 35.0% increase in income tax expense for the six
   months ending June 30, 2011.  The effective tax rates for the six
   months ended June 30, 2010 and 2011 were 38.6% and 35.2%,
   respectively.  Our effective rate is expected to be between 35% and 37%
   for the 2011 fiscal year.

                       Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Sources of Liquidity
   Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations,
   borrowings under our Credit Facility, as defined below, and
   available-for-sale investments. As of June 30, 2011, we had $50.4
   million in cash and cash equivalents, $16.9 million in
   available-for-sale investments and $50.0 million borrowing capacity
   available under our Credit Facility. Our primary liquidity requirements
   are for working capital, capital expenditures, product development
   expenses and general corporate needs. As of June 30, 2011, we had
   working capital of $55.6 million.
   Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
   Higher One, Inc. entered into a senior secured revolving credit
   facility dated as of December 31, 2010. We refer to the credit facility
   as the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility has a maximum amount
   available to be drawn of $100 million, of which $50 million is
   available currently and the remaining $50 million is available subject
   to lender approval.  Any amounts drawn under the Credit Facility are
   payable in a single maturity on December 31, 2013. Higher One Holdings,
   Inc., and each of the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Higher One, Inc., is
   a guarantor of Higher One, Inc.'s obligations under the Credit
   Facility.

   The Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first priority security
   interest in all of the capital stock of Higher One, Inc. and its
   subsidiaries, and substantially all of each Credit Facility guarantor's
   tangible and intangible assets, other than intellectual property. Each
   of the Credit Facility guarantors has also granted to the
   administrative agent under the Credit Facility a negative pledge of the
   intellectual property of Higher One, Inc. and its subsidiaries,
   including patents and trademarks that are pending and acquired in the
   future.
   As of June 30, 2011, Higher One, Inc. had no outstanding indebtedness
   under the Credit Facility.
   The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative covenants including,
   among other things, covenants to furnish the lenders with financial
   statements and other financial information and to provide the lenders
   notice of material events and information regarding collateral. The
   Credit Facility also contains certain negative covenants that, among
   other things, restrict Higher One, Inc.'s ability, subject to certain
   exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on its
   assets, undergo fundamental changes, make investments, sell assets,
   make restricted payments, change the nature of its business and engage
   in transactions with its affiliates.
   In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants
   that require we maintain a minimum EBITDA level of $50 million, a
   funded debt to EBITDA ratio not to exceed 2.00 to 1.00 and a fixed
   charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.00. Each such financial
   covenant is measured using the financial results of the most recent
   four fiscal quarters.  As of June 30, 2011, Higher One, Inc. was in
   compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.

 Increase in cash and cash equivalents
                                             26,529       15,989       (10,540 )
 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period
                                          $  29,868     $ 50,473     $  20,605
   The increase in net cash provided by operating activities consisted of
   an increase of $5.7 million in net income offset by a $1.0 million net
   decrease in adjustments to reconcile net income to cash.  Our non-cash
   expenses decreased by $0.3 million primarily as a result of an increase
   in our deferred income tax benefit and the income we recorded in
   connection with the settlement agreement reached with the former
   stockholders of IDC partially offset by an increase in stock-based
   compensation and stock-based customer acquisition expense.  Our
   operating assets and liabilities used approximately $1.4 million of
   cash, net, during the six months ended June 30, 2011.
   The decrease in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates
   to payments which we made to an escrow agent in 2010 related to our
   acquisition of IDC which did not recur in 2011, which was partially
   offset by an increase in our amount spent on fixed assets related to
   our construction project described below.
   As of June 30, 2011, we have incurred approximately $10.9 million on a
   project to develop two existing commercial buildings located in New
   Haven, Connecticut into which we expect to move at the completion of
   the project in 2012. We anticipate making additional payments in 2011
   and 2012 as progress continues on the project. The project has a total
   estimated cost of approximately $47 million. Our net cost will be
   reduced by federal and state subsidies, grants and tax credits from
   various programs and entities which are described in our annual report
   on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
   We believe that our cash flows from operations, together with our
   existing liquidity sources, will be sufficient to fund our operations
   and anticipated capital expenditures over at least the next twenty-four
   months. We intend to fund our real estate development project using
   existing cash and additional cash generated from operations.
   The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily
   related to our issuance of common stock in 2010, which resulted in net
   proceeds of $37.8 million.  We repaid $18.0 million, net on our then
   existing line of credit during the six months ended June 30, 2010.  The
   only cash flows from financing activities in 2011 have resulted from
   the exercise of stock options.

                   We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before
   interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA,
   further adjusted to remove the effects of stock-based customer
   acquisition expense related to our grants of common stock in connection
   with our acquisition of EduCard in 2008 and cash-based customer
   acquisition expense related to the acquisition of IDC, stock-based
   compensation expense and the gain we recorded in connection with the
   settlement of our litigation with the former stockholders of IDC.
   Neither EBITDA nor adjusted EBITDA should be considered as an
   alternative to net income, operating income or any other measure of
   financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
   Our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly
   titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may
   not calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as we do.
   We prepare and present adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the effect of items
   that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance.
   You are encouraged to evaluate our adjustments and the reasons we
   consider them appropriate.

                   We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to our board of
   directors, management and investors in evaluating our operating
   performance for the following reasons:
                                                                    ·
   adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's
   operating performance without regard to certain items, such as interest
   expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based
   expenses and certain other items, that can vary substantially from
   company to company and from period to period depending upon their
   financing and accounting methods, the book value of their assets, their
   capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired;
                                                                      ·
   securities analysts use adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to
   evaluate the overall operating performance of companies;
                                                                     ·
   because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in
   time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any
   particular time, stock-based customer acquisition expense and
   stock-based compensation expense are not key measures of our core
   operating performance;
                                                                       ·
   because cash-based customer acquisition expense is an item related to
   the acquisition of IDC and does not reflect how our business is
   performing at any particular time, cash-based customer acquisition
   expense is therefore not a key measure of our core operating
   performance; and
                                                                       ·
   because the gain we recorded in connection with the settlement of our
   litigation with the former stockholders of IDC is an item related to
   the acquisition of IDC and does not reflect how our business is
   performing at any particular time.

                                                                     ·
   because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in
   time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any
   particular time, stock-based customer acquisition expense and
   stock-based compensation expense are not key measures of our core
   operating performance;
                                                                       ·
   because cash-based customer acquisition expense is an item related to
   the acquisition of IDC and does not reflect how our business is
   performing at any particular time, cash-based customer acquisition
   expense is therefore not key measure of our core operating performance;
                                                                      ·
   amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company
   and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting
   methods, the fair value and average expected life of their acquired
   intangible assets, their capital structures and the method by which
   their assets were acquired; and
                                                                       ·
   because the gain we recorded in connection with the settlement of our
   litigation with the former stockholders of IDC is an item related to
   the acquisition of IDC and does not reflect how our business is
   performing at any particular time.

                        Critical Accounting Policies

   The significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our
   consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, "Business
   Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of our
   financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the
   year ended December 31, 2010. Under accounting principles generally
   accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and
   assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
   revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
   in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
   estimates.
   We believe the judgments, estimates and assumptions associated with the
   following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential
   impact on our consolidated financial statements:
                                   ·
   Provision for Operational Losses;
                               ·
   Stock-based compensation; and
              ·
   Income taxes
   For a complete discussion of these critical accounting policies, refer
   to "Critical Accounting Policies" within "Item 7 - Management's
   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
   Operations" included within our annual report on Form 10-K for the year
   ended December 31, 2010. At June 30, 2011, there have been no material
   changes to any of the Critical Accounting Policies therein.

                      Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   We review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial
   impact, if any, that the adoption of each such standard will have. The
   adoption of the following three standards did not have a material
   impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
   In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU,
   No. 2009-13 "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements." This ASU
   establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements
   including multiple revenue-generating activities. This ASU provides
   amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables, measuring and
   allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of
   accounting. The amendments in this ASU also establish a selling price
   hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
   Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide
   information about a vendor's multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements,
   including information about the nature and terms, significant
   deliverables and its performance within arrangements. The amendments
   also required providing information about the significant judgments
   made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of
   the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of
   revenue recognition. The amendments in this ASU are effective
   prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially
   modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We
   adopted this standard on January 1, 2011.
   In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, "Certain Revenue
   Arrangements That Include Software Elements." This ASU changes the
   accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible
   products and software elements that are "essential to the
   functionality," and scopes these products out of current software
   revenue guidance. The new guidance will include factors to help
   companies determine what software elements are considered "essential to
   the functionality." The amendments will now subject software-enabled
   products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as
   guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple-deliverables.
   The amendments in this ASU are effective prospectively for revenue
   arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years
   beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We adopted this standard on
   January 1, 2011.
   In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, "Milestone Method of
   Revenue Recognition," which indicates the criteria that should be met
   for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition
   is appropriate. Companies can recognize consideration that is
   contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue
   in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone
   meets all criteria to be considered substantive. This ASU was effective
   for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We adopted this
   standard on January 1, 2011.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [70]Table of Contents

   In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income
   (Topic 220)--Presentation of Comprehensive Income" which requires an
   entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of
   net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in
   a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two
   separate but consecutive statements. This accounting standard update
   eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive
   income as part of the statement of equity and is effective for fiscal
   years beginning after December 15, 2011.  This accounting standard
   update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated
   financial statements.
   In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve
   Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
   and International Financial Reporting Standards", which provides a
   consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value
   measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP
   and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes
   certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure
   requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU
   2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
   December 15, 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting
   ASU 2011-04, but believe there will be no significant impact on our
   consolidated financial statements.
   In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to clarify the
   acquisition date that should be used for reporting pro-forma financial
   information for business combinations. If comparative financial
   statements are presented, the pro-forma revenue and earnings of the
   combined entity for the comparable prior reporting period should be
   reported as though the acquisition date for all business combinations
   that occurred during the current year had been completed as of the
   beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The
   amendments in this guidance are effective prospectively for business
   combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1,
   2011. There will be no impact in the consolidated financial results as
   the amendments relate only to additional disclosures.
   In December 2010, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on
   goodwill impairment testing. The amendments modify Step 1 of the
   goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative
   carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to
   perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely
   than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In making that
   determination, the guidance states that an entity should consider
   whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an
   impairment may exist. The amendments are effective for fiscal years and
   interim periods beginning January 1, 2011 and are not expected to have
   a material impact in the consolidated financial statements.
   Item 3.                                Quantitative and Qualitative
   Disclosures About Market Risk
   Our principal market risk relates to interest rate sensitivity, which
   is the risk that future changes in interest rates will reduce our net
   income or net assets. There have been no material changes in our
   principal market risk exposures from the information disclosed in our
   annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
   In addition, we receive processing fees paid from our bank partner,
   based on prevailing interest rates and the total deposits held in our
   OneAccounts. Since 2008, fees paid by our bank partner have been
   relatively small because of historically low interest rates. A change
   in interest rates would affect the amount of processing fees that we
   earn and therefore would have an effect on our revenue, cash flows and
   results of operations.

   Item 4.                          Controls and Procedures
   Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
   and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
   disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
   15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
   Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2011. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
   Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
   June 30, 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to
   provide reasonable assurance that information is accumulated and
   communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
   and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
   regarding required disclosure, and ensure that information required to
   be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
   recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
   specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
   There has been no change in our internal controls over financial
   reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2011 identified in
   connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d)
   of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this
   report that has materially affected, or is reasonable likely to
   materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

                         PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

   Item 1.                                Legal Proceedings
   On June 22, 2010, Higher One, Inc., or HOI, provided notice and a
   certificate of claim for indemnity under the Stock Purchase Agreement
   by and among us and the former stockholders of Informed Decisions
   Corporation, or IDC, dated November 19, 2009, arising from certain
   misrepresentations and breaches of warranty. At the same time, we
   deposited $8.25 million, equal to the remaining balance of the
   post-closing payments, with an escrow agent.  Separately, the former
   stockholders of IDC filed a complaint against HOI in the United States
   District Court for the Northern District of California, or the
   Complaint, on July 20, 2010, disputing that misrepresentations were
   made and that warranties were breached; alleging breach of contract and
   anticipatory breach; and seeking a declaratory judgment ordering that
   the post-closing payments be made in accordance with the schedule set
   forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
   On April 25, 2011, HOI and the former stockholders of IDC agreed to a
   settlement, the material terms of which are as follows: (a) $2 million
   of the amount held in escrow, plus pro-rated interest, was to be paid
   to HOI; (b) $6.25 million of the amount held in escrow, plus pro-rated
   interest, was to be paid to the former stockholders; and (c) HOI and
   the former stockholders generally and mutually released each other from
   all past and future claims, known and unknown, arising out of the stock
   purchase agreement and related transition services agreements between
   HOI and each of the former stockholders, relating to the operation or
   sale of IDC, including all indemnification and payment obligations,
   with the exception of certain rights, obligations and claims.  The
   amount held in escrow was distributed to HOI and the former
   stockholders of IDC in accordance with the terms of the settlement
   agreement in May 2011.
   We recorded the impact of the settlement agreement in the quarter
   ending June 30, 2011.  The $2 million returned from escrow to us was
   recorded as other income of $1.5 million, reflecting a payment made
   under the indemnification provisions of the stock purchase agreement
   and a reduction of general and administrative expenses of $0.5 million,
   reflecting the recovery of certain legal costs incurred for the
   litigation.
   Except as described above, there have been no material developments in
   our legal proceedings since we filed our annual report on Form 10-K for
   the year ended December 31, 2010.

   [72]Table of Contents

   Item 1A.                      Risk Factors
    There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those
   disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
   31, 2010, except as follows:
   Reviews and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities under banking
   and consumer protection laws and regulations may result in changes to
   our business practices or may expose us to the risk of fines,
   restitution and litigation.
   Our operations and the operations of our bank partner are subject to
   the jurisdiction and examination of federal, state and local regulatory
   authorities, including the FDIC, which is our bank partner's primary
   federal regulator. Our business practices, including the terms of our
   products, are reviewed and approved by our banking partner and subject
   to both periodic and special reviews by such regulatory authorities,
   which can range from investigations into specific consumer complaints
   or concerns to broader inquiries into our practices generally. We and
   our bank partner are subject to ongoing and routine examination by the
   FDIC. If, as part of an examination or review, the regulatory
   authorities conclude that we are not complying with applicable laws or
   regulations, they could request or impose a wide range of remedies,
   including, but not limited to, requiring changes to the terms of our
   products (such as decreases in fees), the imposition of fines or
   penalties or the institution of enforcement proceedings or other
   similar actions against us alleging that our practices constitute
   unfair or deceptive acts or practices. As part of an enforcement
   action, the regulators can seek restitution for affected customers and
   impose civil money penalties. In addition, negative publicity relating
   to any specific inquiry or investigation or any related fine could
   adversely affect our stock price; our relationships with various
   industry participants; or our ability to attract new and retain
   existing clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition and results of operations.
   Following a recently conducted compliance examination, the New York
   Regional Office of the FDIC notified us that it was prepared to
   recommend to the Director of FDIC Supervision that an enforcement
   action be taken against us for alleged violations of certain applicable
   laws and regulations principally relating to our compliance management
   system and policies and practices for past overdraft charging on
   persistently delinquent accounts, collections and transaction error
   resolution. Any such enforcement action could result in an order to pay
   restitution and civil money penalties. We have responded to the FDIC's
   notification, but the process is ongoing and there can be no assurances
   as to the outcome of this process. An action instituted against us that
   results in significant changes to our practices, the imposition on us
   of fines or penalties, or an obligation for us to pay restitution or
   civil money penalties could have a material adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition and results of operations.
   Fees for financial services are subject to increasingly intense
   legislative and regulatory scrutiny, which could have a material
   adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
   operations and prospects for future growth.
   In 2010, 2009 and 2008, approximately 78%, 88% and 85% of our revenue
   was generated from interchange fees, ATM fees, non-sufficient funds
   fees, other banking services fees and convenience fees. These fees, as
   well as the financial services industry in general, have undergone or
   may undergo substantial changes in the near future. These changes could
   have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
   results of operations and prospects for future growth.
   Effective July 1, 2010, the Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation E
   to limit the ability of financial institutions to assess an overdraft
   fee for paying ATM and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw a
   consumer's account, unless the consumer affirmatively consents, or opts
   in, to the institution's payment of overdrafts for these services. In
   the absence of such a consent, a financial institution may not assess
   an overdraft fee on a consumer for an ATM or one-time debit card
   transaction.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [73]Table of Contents

   On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
   Protection Act, or the Act, was signed into law. The Act increases the
   already substantial regulation and oversight of the financial services
   industry and imposes restrictions on the ability of firms within the
   industry, including us, to conduct business consistent with historical
   practices. For example, under the Act, a Consumer Financial Protection
   Bureau, or the Bureau, has been established to regulate any person
   engaged in a "financial activity" in connection with a consumer
   financial product or service, including those, such as us, that process
   financial services products and services. The Bureau has assumed
   regulatory authority for many of the laws to which we and our partner
   bank, The Bancorp Bank, are subject and may have direct supervisory
   authority over us.  The Bureau also will have authority to issue and
   enforce regulations relating to consumer financial protection designed
   to prevent unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices in the offering of
   consumer financial products.
   The Act also requires changes to be made to the manner in which
   merchants accept and process certain debit- and credit-card
   transactions. Specifically, the Act, subject to certain exemptions,
   requires the Federal Reserve to impose limits on debit card interchange
   fees tied to the cost of processing the transaction, which may have the
   result of decreasing revenue to debit card issuers and processors. On
   June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued its final rule
   implementing these limits on debit card interchange fees that, among
   other things would limit interchange fees on debit card transactions to
   a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the
   transaction amount, and up to an additional $0.01 to cover investments
   in fraud prevention measures.  At the same time, the Federal Reserve
   approved an interim final rule that allows for an upward adjustment of
   no more than 1 cent to an issuer's debit card interchange fee if the
   issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably
   designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set out in the
   interim final rule.  These limits become effective October 1, 2011.  In
   accordance with the Act, issuers that, together with their affiliates,
   have less than $10 billion in assets are exempt from the debit card
   interchange fee standards, although they are subject to the
   prohibitions on network exclusivity and routing restrictions.
   Nevertheless, it is anticipated that smaller issuers, such as The
   Bancorp Bank, may also be impacted. Some federal, state, and local
   government-administered payment programs that use debit cards are
   exempt from this interchange fee restriction. Additionally, the Act
   permits merchants to offer a discount or other incentive to encourage
   use of one form of payment over another. Furthermore, the Act, as
   implemented by the Federal Reserve Board's final rule, prohibits an
   issuer or payment card network from restricting the number of payment
   card networks over which an electronic debit transaction may be
   processed to fewer than two unaffiliated networks, or restricting the
   ability of a merchant to direct the routing of electronic debit
   transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to
   process the electronic debit transactions. The Act also allows
   merchants to set minimum purchase thresholds for credit card
   transactions, provided such thresholds do not exceed $10, and it
   permits institutions of higher education and federal agencies - which
   constitute many of our clients - to impose maximum dollar amounts for
   credit-card purchases. Individual state legislatures are also reviewing
   interchange fees, and legislators in a number of states have proposed
   bills that purport to limit interchange fees or merchant discount rates
   or to prohibit their application to portions of a transaction.
   The scope and impact of many of the Act's provisions, including those
   summarized above, will continue to be determined through the rule
   making process. As a result, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of
   the Act on us or The Bancorp Bank at this time, nor can we predict the
   impact or substance of other future legislation or regulation. However,
   we believe that the Act, other recent changes in regulation, including
   the Regulation E changes summarized above, and legislation under
   consideration by the states, could affect how we and our bank partner
   operate by significantly reducing the interchange fees, ATM fees,
   non-sufficient fund fees, other banking services fees and convenience
   fees charged in respect of our services and that drive our financial
   results. These regulatory and legislative changes could also increase
   our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes or
   limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient
   manner. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially and
   adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
   operations.
   Item 2.                      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
   and Use of Proceeds
   None.

   directors of Higher One Holdings, Inc.  The resignation did not involve
   any disagreement on any matter relating to the operations, policies or
   practices of Higher One Holdings, Inc.  Mr. Kanji served on the audit
   and compensation committees of the board of the directors.  Effective
   August 2, 2011, Charles Moran was elected to serve as a member of the
   audit committee and Patrick McFadden was elected to serve as a member
   of the compensation committee.

   At our annual meeting of stockholders held on May 18, 2011, our
   stockholders voted to recommend that a non-binding advisory vote on
   executive compensation be held every three years.  In light of this
   recommendation, we have decided to hold a non-binding advisory vote on
   executive compensation every three years until the next required vote
   on the frequency of a stockholder vote on executive compensation.
