   Significant Accounting Policies

   Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
   and the related interim information contained within the notes to such
   condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
   accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America, or GAAP, and the applicable rules of the Securities
   and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for interim information and quarterly
   reports on Form 10-Q.

   The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
   prepared on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial
   statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year
   ended December 31, 2010, and in the opinion of management, include all
   normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for the fair statement
   of our interim period results reported herein.  The December 31, 2010
   condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited
   financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by
   GAAP.  Due to seasonal fluctuations and other factors, the results of
   operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30,
   2011 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
   the full year.

   The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect our
   financial position and results of operations, including our
   wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and
   balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
   requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that
   affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
   contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
   reporting periods. Actual results could differ from management's
   estimates.

   Basic and Diluted Net Income Available to Common Stockholders per
   Common Share

   As discussed in Note 6 below, on June 22, 2010, we consummated an
   initial public offering of common stock. Had we made a distribution to
   stockholders prior to the initial public offering, all classes of
   preferred stock would have participated pro rata in dividends if and
   when we declared a dividend. Therefore, the two class method of
   calculating basic net income per common share was applied for the nine
   months ended September 30, 2010. Upon completion of the initial public
   offering, all classes of preferred stock converted to common shares. As
   a result, the two class method does not apply to the three months ended
   September 30, 2010 or the three months and nine months ended September
   30, 2011.

   Basic net income per common share excludes dilution for potential
   common stock issuances and is computed by dividing net income available
   to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
   outstanding for the period.  Diluted net income per common share
   reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
   contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
   stock.  For the calculation of diluted net income per common share, the
   basic weighted-average number of shares is increased by the dilutive
   effect of restricted stock and stock options using the treasury-stock
   method.  The treasury-stock method assumes that the options or warrants
   are exercised at the beginning of the year (or date of issue if later),
   and that the company uses those proceeds to purchase common stock for
   treasury at the average price for the reporting period.

   The dilutive effect of stock options totaling 951,748 and 1,057,115
   were not included in the computation of diluted net income per common
   share for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2011,
   respectively, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. The dilutive
   effect of stock options totaling 951,748 and 1,057,115 were not
   included in the computation of diluted net income per common share for
   the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2011, respectively, as
   their effect would be anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive securities are
   securities that upon conversion or exercise increase earnings per share
   (or reduce the loss per share). Restricted stock shares totaling
   1,727,865 and 1,152,933 were not included in the computation of either
   basic or diluted earnings per share as all necessary conditions for
   vesting have not been satisfied by the end of the three and nine months
   ended September 30, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

   Comprehensive Income

   There are no comprehensive income items other than net income. There
   are no recorded unrealized gains or losses on the investments in
   marketable securities as of the balance sheet dates.  Comprehensive
   income equals net income for all periods presented.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Standards Implemented

   We adopted each of the following standards on January 1, 2011.  The
   adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our
   results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  There was no
   material impact to our units of accounting, the way in which we
   allocate consideration to various units of accounting or changes in the
   pattern or timing of revenue recognition.

   In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
   issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2009-13
   "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements." This ASU establishes the
   accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple
   revenue-generating activities. This ASU provides amendments to the
   criteria for separating deliverables, measuring and allocating
   arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The
   amendments in this ASU also establish a selling price hierarchy for
   determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced
   disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor's
   multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about
   the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance
   within arrangements. The amendments also require providing information
   about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and
   about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects
   the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The amendments in this ASU
   were effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
   materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15,
   2010.



   In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, "Certain Revenue
   Arrangements That Include Software Elements." This ASU changes the
   accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible
   products and software elements that are essential to the functionality
   of the product, and scopes these products out of current software
   revenue guidance. The new guidance includes factors to help companies
   determine what software elements are considered essential to the
   functionality of the product. The amendments subject software-enabled
   products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as
   guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple-deliverables.
   The amendments in this ASU were effective prospectively for revenue
   arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years
   beginning on or after June 15, 2010.

   In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, "Milestone Method of
   Revenue Recognition," which indicates the criteria that should be met
   for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is
   appropriate. Companies can recognize consideration that is contingent
   upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the
   period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets
   all criteria to be considered substantive. This ASU was effective for
   fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements - New Standards to be Implemented

   In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, "Intangibles -
   Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Testing Goodwill for Impairment," which
   permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is
   more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than
   its carrying value before applying the two-step goodwill impairment
   model that is currently in place. If it is determined through the
   qualitative assessment that a reporting unit's fair value is more
   likely than not greater than its carrying value, the remaining
   impairment steps would be unnecessary. The qualitative assessment is
   optional, allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative
   assessment. This update is effective for annual and interim goodwill
   impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
   2011; however early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this
   standard for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 and do not expect
   the standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
   statements.

   In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income
   (Topic 220)--Presentation of Comprehensive Income," which requires an
   entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of
   net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in
   a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two
   separate but consecutive statements. This accounting standard update
   eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive
   income as part of the statement of equity and is effective for fiscal
   years beginning after December 15, 2011.  The FASB has announced that
   certain aspects of this update may be delayed; however as issued in
   June 2011, this accounting standard update is not expected to have a
   significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we do
   not currently have any items recorded in other comprehensive income.

   In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve
   Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
   and International Financial Reporting Standards," which provides a
   consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value
   measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP
   and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes
   certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure
   requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU
   2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
   December 15, 2011. We believe there will be no significant impact on
   our consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting ASU
   2011-04.

   In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to clarify the
   acquisition date that should be used for reporting pro-forma financial
   information for business combinations. If comparative financial
   statements are presented, the pro-forma revenue and earnings of the
   combined entity for the comparable prior reporting period should be
   reported as though the acquisition date for all business combinations
   that occurred during the current year had been completed as of the
   beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The
   amendments in this guidance are effective prospectively for business
   combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1,
   2011. There will be no impact on our consolidated financial results as
   the amendments relate only to additional disclosures.

   In December 2010, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on
   goodwill impairment testing. The amendments modify step 1 of the
   goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative
   carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to
   perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely
   than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In making such a
   determination, the guidance states that an entity should consider
   whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an
   impairment may exist. The amendments are effective for fiscal years and
   interim periods beginning January 1, 2011 and are not expected to have
   a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

   Investments in Marketable Securities and Fair Value Measurements

   As of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, all of our investments
   in marketable securities were classified as available for
   sale.  Amortized cost basis was equal to aggregate fair value for each
   of the major security types as reflected in the table below. We had no
   recorded unrealized gains or losses from investments as of December 31,
   2010 and September 30, 2011.  The contractual maturities of our
   available for sale securities ranged from one to twelve months as of
   September 30, 2011.

   All of our assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis
   are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
   assets (Level 1).  We do not have any liabilities carried at fair value
   as of either September 30, 2011 or December 31, 2010. The following
   table provides the assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring
   basis as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 (in thousands of
   dollars):

   Real Estate Development Project

   As of September 30, 2011, we have incurred approximately $27.3 million
   on a project to develop two existing commercial buildings located in
   New Haven, Connecticut.  We will move into these buildings at the
   completion of the project, which is expected to be in late 2011 or
   early 2012.  In connection with the real estate development project,
   HOI and Real Estate LLC entered into an agreement with the Connecticut
   Development Authority that provides for sales and use tax relief for
   property purchases made for the project.  The total amount of potential
   sales and use tax relief is $1.0 million.  The conditions of the sales
   and use tax agreement require repayment to the Connecticut Development
   Authority of the actual amount of sales and use tax savings plus an
   additional 7.5% if HOI fails to meet certain criteria.  In accordance
   with this obligation, we deposited $1.1 million into an escrow account
   in February 2011, which is reflected on the condensed consolidated
   balance sheet as noncurrent restricted cash.

   5.

   Credit Facility

   On December 31, 2010, HOI entered into a senior secured revolving
   credit facility, or the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2011,
   $50.0 million in borrowings were available to us under the Credit
   Facility and we were in compliance with all of the applicable
   affirmative, negative and financial covenants in the Credit Facility.
   The amount available to be drawn under the Credit Facility may be
   increased by an additional $50.0 million upon our request and the
   agreement of the lenders party to the Credit Facility.

   Capital Stock

   Initial Public Offering

   On June 22, 2010, we consummated an initial public offering of
   3,569,395 shares of newly issued common stock and 6,780,605 shares
   offered by selling stockholders. The aggregate public offering price of
   the offering amount registered was $124.2 million and the offering did
   not terminate before all of the shares registered in the registration
   statement were sold. Our proceeds of $37.2 million, net of issuance
   costs, were used to pay outstanding amounts on our credit facility in
   effect at that time, make an escrow payment of $8.25 million related to
   the acquisition payable described in Note 7 below and fund working
   capital. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares
   by the selling stockholders.

   Upon consummation of our initial public offering, 417,049 shares of
   Series A convertible preferred stock outstanding, 1,086,784 shares of
   Series B convertible preferred stock outstanding, 2,522,554 shares of
   Series C convertible preferred stock outstanding, 2,180,633 shares of
   Series C-1 convertible preferred stock outstanding, 1,313,604 shares of
   Series D convertible preferred stock outstanding and 5,454,545 shares
   of Series E convertible preferred stock outstanding were converted into
   38,925,507 shares of common stock after giving effect to the 3-for-1
   stock split discussed below. Following the consummation of the
   offering, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

   Common Stock

   In connection with the initial public offering, we effected a 3-for-1
   stock split of the outstanding shares of our common stock that was
   previously approved by stockholders. All common share amounts and per
   common share amounts have been adjusted in the financial statements for
   all periods presented. We are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000
   shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. Each share
   of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters
   submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Common stockholders are not
   entitled to receive dividends unless declared by the board of
   directors.

   Preferred Stock

   We are authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a
   par value of $0.001 per share.  As of December 31, 2010 and September
   30, 2011, no shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding.

   Treasury Stock

   In August 2011, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase
   program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $40.0 million of our
   issued and outstanding shares of common stock through September 7,
   2012.  During the three months ended September 30, 2011, we repurchased
   943,549 shares of our common stock at a cost of $14.2 million.  All
   shares repurchased were held in treasury as of September 30, 2011.

   Commitments and Contingencies

   From time to time we are subject to litigation relating to matters in
   the ordinary course of business, as well as regulatory examinations,
   information gathering requests, inquiries and investigations.

   In February 2011, the New York Regional Office of the Federal Deposit
   Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, notified us that it was prepared to
   recommend to the Director of FDIC Supervision that an enforcement
   action be taken against us for alleged violations of certain applicable
   laws and regulations principally relating to our compliance management
   system and policies and practices for past overdraft charging on
   persistently delinquent accounts, collections and transaction error
   resolution. Any such enforcement action could result in an order to pay
   restitution and civil money penalties. We have responded to the FDIC's
   notification and have amended certain practices. In view of the
   inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of regulatory matters,
   including the FDIC notification, we generally cannot predict what the
   eventual outcome of pending matters will be or what the timing of the
   ultimate resolution of these matters will be.  While the process is
   ongoing, we continue to evaluate various potential courses of action in
   order to resolve this matter.  The potential courses of action could
   include increased utilization of external legal counsel to defend our
   position, voluntarily adopting a program which would provide
   restitution to current and former customers or continuing to let the
   current process progress through additional correspondence between us
   and the FDIC. Our pursuit of any of these courses of action could
   result in additional costs; however, we currently estimate the
   potential range of loss associated with these matters to be between $0
   and $10 million. An adverse outcome in one or more of these matters
   could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any
   particular reporting period. In accordance with applicable accounting
   guidance, we would establish a liability for litigation and regulatory
   matters if and when those matters were to present loss contingencies
   that were both probable and reasonably estimable.

   On June 22, 2010, HOI provided notice and a certificate of claim for
   indemnity under the Stock Purchase Agreement by and among us and the
   former stockholders of Informed Decisions Corporation, or IDC, dated
   November 19, 2009, arising from certain misrepresentations and breaches
   of warranty. At the same time, we deposited $8.25 million, equal to the
   remaining balance of the post-closing payments, with an escrow
   agent. Separately, the former stockholders of IDC filed a complaint
   against HOI in the United States District Court for the Northern
   District of California, or the Complaint, on July 20, 2010, disputing
   that misrepresentations were made and that warranties were breached;
   alleging breach of contract and anticipatory breach; and seeking a
   declaratory judgment ordering that the post-closing payments be made in
   accordance with the schedule set forth in the stock purchase agreement.

   On April 25, 2011, HOI and the former stockholders of IDC agreed to a
   settlement, the material terms of which are as follows: (a) $2 million
   of the amount held in escrow, plus pro-rated interest, was to be paid
   to HOI; (b) $6.25 million of the amount held in escrow, plus pro-rated
   interest, was to be paid to the former stockholders; and (c) HOI and
   the former stockholders generally and mutually released each other from
   all past and future claims, known and unknown, arising out of the stock
   purchase agreement and related transition services agreements between
   HOI and each of the former stockholders, relating to the operation or
   sale of IDC, including all indemnification and payment obligations,
   with the exception of certain rights, obligations and claims.  The
   amount held in escrow was distributed to HOI and the former
   stockholders of IDC in accordance with the terms of the settlement
   agreement in May 2011.

   We recorded the impact of the settlement agreement in the quarter
   ending June 30, 2011.  The $2 million returned from escrow to us was
   recorded as other income of $1.5 million, reflecting a payment made
   under the indemnification provisions of the stock purchase agreement
   and a reduction of general and administrative expenses of $0.5 million,
   reflecting the recovery of certain legal costs incurred for the
   litigation.

   In February 2009 and September 2010, HOI filed two separate complaints
   against TouchNet Information Systems, Inc., or TouchNet, in the United
   States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging patent
   infringement related to TouchNet's offering for sale and sales of its
   "eRefund" product in violation of one of two of HOI's patents. In the
   complaints, HOI sought judgments that TouchNet has infringed two of
   HOI's patents, a judgment that TouchNet pay damages and interest on
   damages to compensate HOI for infringement, an award of HOI's costs in
   connection with these actions and an injunction barring TouchNet from
   further infringing HOI's patent. TouchNet answered the complaint and
   asserted a number of defenses and counterclaims, including that it does
   not infringe HOI's patent, that HOI's patent is invalid or
   unenforceable and certain allegations of unfair competition and state
   and federal antitrust violations. In addition, TouchNet's counterclaims
   sought dismissal of HOI's claims with prejudice, declaratory judgment
   that TouchNet does not infringe HOI's patent and that HOI's patent is
   invalid or unenforceable, as well as an award of fees and costs related
   to the action, and an injunction permanently enjoining HOI from suing
   TouchNet regarding infringement of HOI's patent. The parties are
   currently in the discovery stage of the proceeding. HOI intends to
   pursue the matter vigorously. There can be no assurances of success in
   these proceedings.

   Item 2.                                Management's Discussion and
   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

   The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction
   with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as
   included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
   31, 2010 and information contained elsewhere in such annual report on
   Form 10-K and in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The discussion
   contains forward-looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and
   assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from
   expectations. Factors that might cause these differences include those
   described under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the annual report on
   Form 10-K and in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The
   forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form
   10-Q are made only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake
   any obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking statements
   to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by
   law. We cannot assure you that projected results or events will be
   achieved or will occur.

                                  Overview

   We believe that based on market share and the number of campuses
   employing our products, we are a leading provider of technology and
   payment services to the higher education industry. We believe that none
   of our competitors can match our ability to provide solutions for
   higher education institutions' financial services needs, including
   compliance monitoring, and, consequently, that we provide the most
   comprehensive suite of disbursement and payment solutions specifically
   designed for higher education institutions and their students. We also
   provide campus communities with convenient, cost-competitive and
   student-oriented banking services, which include extensive
   user-friendly features.

   Our products and services for our higher education institutional
   clients include our OneDisburse® Refund Management® funds disbursement
   service and our CASHNet® suite of payment transaction products and
   services. Through our bank partner, we offer our OneAccount service to
   the students of our higher education institutional clients, which
   includes an FDIC-insured deposit account, a OneCard, which is a debit
   MasterCard® ATM card, and other retail banking services.

   As of September 30, 2011, more than 490 campuses serving approximately
   4.0 million students had purchased the OneDisburse service.  The number
   of students served as of September 30, 2011 includes an additional 115
   thousand students as a result of overall enrollment growth at these
   campuses and an increase of 197 thousand students from the level as of
   June 30, 2011.  We rely on fall enrollment data provided by the U.S.
   Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences, Integrated
   Postsecondary Education Data System, or IPEDS, to count the number of
   students at our higher education institutional clients.  The IPEDS data
   is updated annually, usually in our third quarter, to reflect fall
   enrollments as of the prior year.  Since December 31, 2010, including
   enrollment growth, we have added a total of 689 thousand students,
   representing 21.0% growth.  As of September 30, 2011, more than 350
   campuses serving approximately 2.6 million students had contracted to
   use one or more of our CASHNet payment products and services. As of
   September 30, 2011, there were approximately 2.0 million OneAccounts.

   As we previously reported, on August 8, 2011 we were notified by our
   bank partner, The Bancorp Bank, of its intention to terminate the
   services agreement pursuant to which it provides our customers
   FDIC-insured depository services for the OneAccount checking accounts
   and other services related to the OneAccount.  Under the terms of the
   services agreement with The Bancorp Bank, we maintain responsibility
   for the technology-related aspects of the OneAccounts.  Upon
   termination of the services agreement, The Bancorp Bank is obligated to
   transfer the deposits and any related bank identification numbers,
   routing numbers and other related identifiers used by us in connection
   with the deposits of its customers and deliver any and all applicable
   information, account opening contracts and related items.  Pursuant to
   the notice received, the termination will be effective no later than
   May 4, 2012, or 270 days after the date of the termination notice,
   unless the services agreement is otherwise extended or the terms of the
   termination notice are changed.

   We have been in discussions with other potential bank partners
   throughout 2011 and have increased the pace of such discussions since
   we received the termination notice described above.  We believe that
   there is sufficient time for us to transition the services provided by
   The Bancorp Bank to a different bank partner or partners in the
   required timeline.  We are also using this transition to further
   evaluate the manner in which banking services are provided to our
   OneAccount customers.  See Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this
   quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

   We continue to assess the impact of certain legislative and regulatory
   changes that have been enacted or made effective that may impact our
   operations and revenue. Effective July 1, 2010, the Federal Reserve
   Board amended its regulations implementing the Electronic Funds
   Transfer Act, or Regulation E, to limit the ability of financial
   institutions to assess overdraft fees for paying ATM and one-time debit
   card transactions that overdraw a consumer's account, unless the
   consumer affirmatively consents, or opts in, to the institution's
   payments of overdrafts for these services. On July 21, 2010, the
   Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Act,
   was signed into law. The Act will change many banking practices over
   time, however, the scope and impact of many of the Act's provisions are
   still being defined through the rule making process. On June 29, 2011,
   the Federal Reserve issued its final rule implementing the limits on
   debit card interchange fees and requirements for future routing of
   transactions required by the Act.  In accordance with the Act, issuers
   that, together with their affiliates, have less than $10 billion in
   assets are exempt from these debit card interchange fee limits,
   although they are subject to the prohibitions on network exclusivity
   and routing restrictions.  Our current banking partner, The Bancorp
   Bank, has assets of less than $10 billion and therefore is exempt from
   the debit card interchange fee cap.  While we do not currently expect
   the limitation on debit card interchange fees or the provisions
   relating to network exclusivity and routing restrictions to have a
   material effect on our results of operations, we will continue to
   evaluate the Act, the ongoing rule making process and their effect on
   our business and results of operations.  Our search for potential bank
   partners is focused on those banks that have assets of less than $10
   billion and would therefore also be exempt from the debit card
   interchange fee limits described above.  See Part II, Item 1A. "Risk
   Factors" in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.


   11
     __________________________________________________________________



   Our revenue fluctuates as a result of seasonal factors related to the
   academic year. A large proportion of our revenue is either directly or
   indirectly dependent on academic financial aid received by students.
   Higher education institutional clients typically disburse financial aid
   refunds to students at the start of each academic term. Distribution of
   financial aid disbursements through our OneDisburse service (1)
   indirectly generates revenue through deposits of financial aid into
   OneAccounts, which generates account revenue, and (2) directly
   generates revenue through our higher education institution clients' use
   of the OneDisburse service, which generates higher education
   institution revenue.

   While revenue fluctuates over the course of the year, our fixed
   expenses remain relatively constant, resulting in wide disparities in
   our net income and adjusted net income from quarter to quarter.
   Typically, the second quarter accounts for the smallest proportion of
   our revenues but an equal proportion of certain of our expenses. This
   is primarily because the majority of financial aid is disbursed during
   other times of the year and higher education institutions tend to
   enroll more new students in the third fiscal quarter. We expect that
   this trend will continue going forward.

   As previously disclosed in our annual report of Form 10-K for the year
   ending December 31, 2010, the New York Regional Office of the FDIC
   notified us that it was prepared to recommend to the Director of FDIC
   Supervision that an enforcement action be taken against us for alleged
   violations of certain applicable laws and regulations principally
   relating to our compliance management system and policies and practices
   for past overdraft charging on persistently delinquent accounts,
   collections and transaction error resolution. We have responded to the
   FDIC's notification, but the process is ongoing and there can be no
   assurances as to the outcome of this process. While the process is
   ongoing, we continue to evaluate various potential courses of action in
   order to resolve this matter.  The potential courses of action could
   include increased use of outside legal counsel to defend our position,
   voluntarily adopting a program which would provide restitution to
   current and former customers or continuing to let the current process
   progress through additional correspondence between us and the
   FDIC.  Our pursuit of any of these courses of action could result in
   additional costs and we currently estimate the potential range of loss
   associated with these matters to be between $0 and $10 million.

   Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 Compared to the Three Months
   Ended September 30, 2010

   Revenue

   Account revenue

   The increase in account revenue was primarily due to an increase of
   31.0%, or 0.5 million, in the number of OneAccounts from September 30,
   2010 to September 30, 2011.  Greater adoption and student enrollments
   at higher education institutions which were clients as of September 30,
   2010 accounted for 76% of the increase in the number of
   OneAccounts.  The remaining increase was due to students choosing the
   OneAccount at higher education institutions which became clients after
   September 30, 2010.  The increase in the number of OneAccounts resulted
   in increases in interchange fees, ATM fees and other fees that our bank
   partner remits to us. While our historical experience has been that
   account revenue generated per OneAccount has been generally stable year
   over year, with total account revenue generally increasing
   proportionally with increases in the number of OneAccounts, the
   implementation of amendments to Regulation E in the third quarter of
   2010 decreased the account revenue per OneAccount compared to the same
   period in the prior year.  We expect future account revenue per
   OneAccount to be stable on a year over year basis as we have now
   experienced a full year of impact related to the implementation of
   amendments to Regulation E.

   Payment Transaction Revenue

   The increase in payment transaction revenue was primarily due to the
   inclusion of new higher education institution clients that began
   utilizing the CASHNet payment module, ePayment, since the three months
   ended September 30, 2010 as well as an increase in payments processed
   at higher education institutions that were clients during the three
   months ended September 30, 2010.



   Higher Education Institution Revenue

   The increase in higher education institution revenue was primarily due
   to an increase in subscription revenue for our CASHNet suite of payment
   products.  The increase in subscription revenue is generally due to the
   increase in number of new modules sold to previously existing higher
   education institution clients, as well as sales of the CASHNet suite of
   payment products to new higher education institution clients over the
   course of the last twelve months.  The increase in higher education
   institution revenue was also supported by growth in the financial aid
   disbursement revenues generated by our OneDisburse Refund Management
   disbursement service.

     __________________________________________________________________



   Cost of Revenue

   Cost of revenue is expected generally to increase proportionally with
   our revenue as many of these costs are variable and associated with
   either the number of OneAccounts or the dollar volume of transactions
   processed through our CASHNet payment module.  During the three months
   ended September 30, 2011, our cost of revenue increased at a higher
   rate than revenue, which resulted in a lower gross margin compared to
   the three months ended September 30, 2010.  During the three months
   ended September 30, 2011, customer service costs and write-offs and the
   provision for uncollectible fees both increased at higher rates than
   our revenue growth.

   General and Administrative Expense

   Although general and administrative expenses continue to increase as
   our size grows, such expenses are increasing at a lower rate than our
   revenue growth.  The increase in general and administrative expenses
   was driven primarily by an increase in professional fees, an increase
   in depreciation and amortization and also losses recorded on the
   disposal of ATMs.  The loss on disposal of ATMs is associated with the
   replacement of a portion of our ATMs during the quarter ended September
   30, 2011.

   Product Development Expense

   The increase in product development expense was primarily due to
   increases in personnel costs.

   Sales and Marketing Expense

   The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to an
   increase of $0.2 million in non-cash, stock-based sales acquisition
   expense related to the vesting of certain shares issued in connection
   with the acquisition of EduCard, LLC due to a higher average share
   price at the date of vesting.  The expense recorded related to the
   shares issued in connection with the acquisition of EduCard, LLC can be
   highly variable from period to period depending on the number of
   additional shares that vest and the average share price at the time of
   vesting.  Higher personnel related costs, including stock-based
   compensation, also contributed to the increase.

   Income Tax Expense

   The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in
   net income before taxes.  The effective tax rates for the three months
   ended September 30, 2010 and 2011 were 39.9% and 35.8%,
   respectively.  Our effective rate is expected to be between 35% and 37%
   for the 2011 fiscal year.

   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011 Compared to the Nine Months Ended
   September 30, 2010

   Revenue

   Account revenue

   The increase in account revenue was primarily due to an increase of
   31.0%, or 0.5 million, in the number of OneAccounts from September 30,
   2010 to September 30, 2011.  Greater adoption and student enrollments
   at higher education institutions which were clients as of September 30,
   2010 accounted for 76% of the increase in the number of
   OneAccounts.  The remaining increase was due to students choosing the
   OneAccount at higher education institutions which became clients after
   September 30, 2010.  The increase in the number of OneAccounts resulted
   in increases in interchange fees, ATM fees and other fees that our bank
   partner remits to us. While our historical experience has been that
   account revenue generated per OneAccount has been generally stable year
   over year, with total account revenue generally increasing
   proportionally with increases in the number of OneAccounts, the
   implementation of amendments to Regulation E in the third quarter of
   2010 decreased the account revenue per OneAccount compared to the same
   period in the prior year.  We expect future account revenue per
   OneAccount to be stable on a year over year basis as we have now had a
   full year of impact related to the implementation of amendments to
   Regulation E.

   Payment Transaction Revenue

   The increase in payment transaction revenue was primarily due to an
   increase in payments processed at higher education institutions that
   were clients during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as well as
   the inclusion of new higher education institution clients that began
   utilizing the CASHNet payment module, ePayment, since the nine months
   ended September 30, 2010

   Higher Education Institution Revenue

   The increase in higher education institution revenue was primarily due
   to an increase in subscription revenue for our CASHNet suite of payment
   products.  The increase in subscription revenue reflects a steady
   increase in the rate of subscription revenue since the fourth quarter
   of 2010 and reflects amounts earned both on new modules sold to
   previously existing higher education institution clients, as well as
   sales of the CASHNet suite of payment products to new higher education
   institution clients. The increase in higher education institution
   revenue was also supported by growth in the financial aid disbursement
   revenue generated by our OneDisburse Refund Management funds
   disbursement service.

   Cost of Revenue

   Cost of revenue is expected generally to increase proportionally with
   our revenue as many of these costs are variable and associated with
   either the number of OneAccounts or the dollar volume of transactions
   processed through our CASHNet payment module.  During the nine months
   ended September 30, 2011, our cost of revenue increased at a higher
   rate than revenue, which resulted in a lower gross margin percentage
   compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010.  During the nine
   months ending September 30, 2011, customer service costs and write-offs
   and the provision for uncollectible fees both increased at higher rates
   than our revenue growth.

   General and Administrative Expense

   Although general and administrative expenses continue to increase as
   our size grows, such expenses are increasing at a lower rate than our
   revenue growth.  The increase in general and administrative expenses
   was driven primarily by an increase in cash-based and stock-based
   employee compensation costs, professional fees and depreciation and
   amortization.  There are also increases in varied expenses to support
   our business growth, including insurance costs, costs to maintain our
   fleet of ATMs, telecommunications and other technology costs.

   Product Development Expense

   The increase in product development expense was primarily due to
   increases in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation,
   partially offset by a decrease in costs related to outsourced services.

   Sales and Marketing Expense

   The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to an
   increase of $2.2 million in non-cash, stock-based sales acquisition
   expense related to the vesting of certain shares issued in connection
   with the acquisition of EduCard, LLC due to a higher average share
   price at the date of vesting as well as additional shares vesting.  The
   expense recorded related to the shares issued in connection with the
   acquisition of EduCard, LLC can be highly variable from period to
   period depending on the number of additional shares that vest and the
   average share price at the time of vesting.  Additional advertising and
   tradeshow participation expenses also contributed to the overall
   increase.






   16
     __________________________________________________________________



   Interest Expense

   The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower
   amortization of deferred financing costs of the Credit Facility (as
   defined below), compared to our prior credit facility that was in place
   during 2010 and the accretion of acquisition payable during 2010 which
   became fully accreted throughout 2010.  During the nine months ended
   September 30, 2011, a zero balance was maintained on the Credit
   Facility.

   Other Income

   We recorded $1.5 million of other income during the nine months ended
   September 30, 2011 as a result of the settlement agreement reached with
   the former stockholders of IDC, or the Settlement Agreement.  See Part
   II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings, for additional information related to
   the Settlement Agreement.



   Income Tax Expense

   The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in
   net income before taxes.  The gain we recorded as a result of the
   settlement agreement with the former stockholders of IDC of $1.5
   million did not have any tax impact, which resulted in only a 25.1%
   increase in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30,
   2011.  The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30,
   2010 and 2011 were 39.1% and 35.4%, respectively.  Our effective rate
   is expected to be between 35% and 37% for the 2011 fiscal year.

                       Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Sources of Liquidity

   Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations,
   borrowings under our Credit Facility, as defined below, and
   available-for-sale investments. As of September 30, 2011, we had $33.4
   million in cash and cash equivalents, $17.9 million in
   available-for-sale investments and $50.0 million in borrowing capacity
   available under our Credit Facility. Our primary liquidity requirements
   are for working capital, capital expenditures, product development
   expenses and general corporate needs. As of September 30, 2011, we had
   working capital of $36.3 million.

   Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility

   Higher One, Inc. entered into a senior secured revolving credit
   facility dated as of December 31, 2010, which we refer to as the Credit
   Facility. As of September 30, 2011, $50 million in borrowings were
   available to the Company under the Credit Facility. The amount
   available to be drawn under the Credit Facility may be increased by an
   additional $50 million upon the request of the Company and the
   agreement of the lenders party to the Credit Facility.  Any amounts
   drawn under the Credit Facility are payable in a single maturity on
   December 31, 2013. Higher One Holdings, Inc., and each of the
   wholly-owned subsidiaries of Higher One, Inc., is a guarantor of Higher
   One, Inc.'s obligations under the Credit Facility.



   The Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first priority security
   interest in all of the capital stock of Higher One, Inc. and its
   subsidiaries, and substantially all of each Credit Facility guarantor's
   tangible and intangible assets, other than intellectual property. Each
   of the Credit Facility guarantors has also granted to the
   administrative agent under the Credit Facility a negative pledge of the
   intellectual property of Higher One, Inc. and its subsidiaries,
   including patents and trademarks that are pending and acquired in the
   future.

   As of September 30, 2011, Higher One, Inc. had no outstanding
   indebtedness under the Credit Facility.

   The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative covenants including,
   among other things, covenants to furnish the lenders with financial
   statements and other financial information and to provide the lenders
   notice of material events and information regarding collateral. The
   Credit Facility also contains certain negative covenants that, among
   other things, restrict Higher One, Inc.'s ability, subject to certain
   exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on its
   assets, undergo fundamental changes, make investments, sell assets,
   make restricted payments, change the nature of its business and engage
   in transactions with its affiliates.

   In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants
   that require us to maintain a minimum EBITDA level, as defined in the
   Credit Facility, of $50 million, a funded debt to EBITDA ratio not to
   exceed 2.00 to 1.00 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25
   to 1.00. Each such financial covenant is measured using the financial
   results of the most recent four fiscal quarters.  As of September 30,
   2011, Higher One, Inc. was in compliance with all covenants under the
   Credit Facility.

   The increase in net cash provided by operating activities consisted of
   an increase of $7.7 million in net income offset by a $3.4 million net
   decrease in adjustments to reconcile net income to cash.  Our non-cash
   expenses increased by $0.6 million primarily as a result of an increase
   in stock-based customer acquisition expense and stock-based
   compensation partially offset by the income we recorded in connection
   with the Settlement Agreement.  Our operating assets and liabilities
   used an additional $4.1 million of cash, net, during the nine months
   ended September 30, 2011 compared to the nine months ended September
   30, 2010.

   The decrease in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates
   to our decreased use of cash in the purchases and proceeds of our
   investments in marketable securities and the payment which we made to
   an escrow agent in 2010 related to our acquisition of IDC which did not
   recur in 2011.  These decreases in cash use were partially offset by an
   increase in our amount spent on fixed assets primarily related to our
   construction project described below.

   As of September 30, 2011, we have incurred approximately $27.6 million
   on a project to develop two existing commercial buildings located in
   New Haven, Connecticut into which we will move at the completion of the
   project, which is expected to be in late 2011 or early 2012. Of the
   $27.6 million incurred, we have spent approximately $17.9 million in
   total on the project as of September 30, 2011.  We anticipate making
   additional payments in 2011 and 2012 as progress continues on the
   project. The project has a total estimated cost of approximately $47
   million. Our net cost will be reduced by federal and state subsidies,
   grants and tax credits from various programs and entities which are
   described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
   31, 2010, some of which we expect to receive in the fourth quarter of
   2011.

   We believe that our cash flows from operations, together with our
   existing liquidity sources, will be sufficient to fund our operations
   and anticipated capital expenditures over at least the next twenty-four
   months. We intend to fund our real estate development project using
   existing cash and additional cash generated from operations.

   The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily
   related to the issuance of our common stock in 2010, which resulted in
   net proceeds of $37.2 million.  We repaid $18.0 million, net, on our
   then existing line of credit during the nine months ended September 30,
   2010.  The only cash flows from financing activities in 2011 have
   resulted from our common stock repurchases which used $14.2 million of
   cash and the exercise of stock options, which provided cash in an
   aggregate amount of $6.3 million.

   (1)            We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest,
   income taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, further
   adjusted to remove the effects of stock-based customer acquisition
   expense related to our grants of common stock in connection with our
   acquisition of EduCard in 2008 and cash-based customer acquisition
   expense related to the acquisition of IDC, stock-based compensation
   expense and the gain we recorded in connection with the settlement of
   our litigation with the former stockholders of IDC. Neither EBITDA nor
   adjusted EBITDA should be considered as an alternative to net income,
   operating income or any other measure of financial performance
   calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA and
   adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of
   other organizations because other organizations may not calculate
   EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as we do. We prepare and
   present adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the effect of items that we do not
   consider indicative of our core operating performance. You are
   encouraged to evaluate our adjustments and the reasons we consider them
   appropriate.



                   We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to our board of
   directors, management and investors in evaluating our operating
   performance for the following reasons:

                                                                    ·
   adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's
   operating performance without regard to certain items, such as interest
   expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based
   expenses and certain other items, that can vary substantially from
   company to company and from period to period depending upon their
   financing and accounting methods, the book value of their assets, their
   capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired;

                                                                      ·
   securities analysts use adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to
   evaluate the overall operating performance of companies;

                                                                     ·
   because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in
   time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any
   particular time, stock-based customer acquisition expense and
   stock-based compensation expense are not key measures of our core
   operating performance;

                                                                       ·
   because cash-based customer acquisition expense is an item related to
   the acquisition of IDC and does not reflect how our business is
   performing at any particular time, cash-based customer acquisition
   expense is therefore not a key measure of our core operating
   performance; and

                                                                       ·
   because the gain we recorded in connection with the settlement of our
   litigation with the former stockholders of IDC is an item related to
   the acquisition of IDC and does not reflect how our business is
   performing at any particular time.

   (2)           We define adjusted net income as net income, adjusted to
   eliminate (a) stock-based compensation expense related to incentive
   stock option grants and the gain we recorded in connection with the
   settlement of our litigation with the former stockholders of IDC and
   (b) after giving effect to tax adjustments, stock-based compensation
   expense related to non-qualified stock option grants, stock-based
   customer acquisition expense related to our grant of common stock in
   connection with our acquisition of EduCard in 2008, cash-based customer
   acquisition expense related to the acquisition of IDC and amortization
   expenses related to intangible assets and financing costs. Adjusted net
   income should not be considered as an alternative to net income,
   operating income or any other measure of financial performance
   calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our adjusted net
   income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
   organizations because other organizations may not calculate adjusted
   net income in the same manner as we do. We prepare adjusted net income
   to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of
   our core operating performance. You are encouraged to evaluate our
   adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.

                   We believe adjusted net income is useful to our board
   of directors, management and investors in evaluating our operating
   performance for the following reasons:

                                                                     ·
   because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in
   time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any
   particular time, stock-based customer acquisition expense and
   stock-based compensation expense are not key measures of our core
   operating performance;

                                                                       ·
   because cash-based customer acquisition expense is an item related to
   the acquisition of IDC and does not reflect how our business is
   performing at any particular time, cash-based customer acquisition
   expense is therefore not a key measure of our core operating
   performance;

                                                                      ·
   amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company
   and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting
   methods, the fair value and average expected life of their acquired
   intangible assets, their capital structures and the method by which
   their assets were acquired; and

                                                                       ·

   litigation with the former stockholders of IDC is an item related to

   in particular our Credit Facility agreement.





                           Contractual Obligations

   There have been no material changes to our contractual commitments from
   those disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
   December 31, 2010.  During the three months ended September 30, 2011,
   we entered into a lease agreement for office space in Atlanta,
   Georgia.  Our contractual obligation under this lease agreement is less
   than $2.0 million over the next seven years.

                       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

   We are not a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements that
   have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
   financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
   expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
   capital resources.

                        Critical Accounting Policies

   The significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our
   consolidated financial statements are described in Note 2,
   "\Significant Accounting Policies" of our notes to consolidated
   financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the
   year ended December 31, 2010. Under accounting principles generally
   accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and
   assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
   revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
   in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
   estimates.

   We believe the judgments, estimates and assumptions associated with the
   following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential
   impact on our consolidated financial statements:

                                   ·
   Provision for operational losses;

                               ·
   Stock-based compensation; and

              ·
   Income taxes

   For a complete discussion of these critical accounting policies, refer
   to "Critical Accounting Policies" within "Item 7 - Management's
   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
   Operations" included within our annual report on Form 10-K for the year
   ended December 31, 2010. At September 30, 2011, there have been no
   material changes to any of the Critical Accounting Policies described
   therein.

                      Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   We review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial
   impact, if any, that the adoption of each such standard will have. The
   adoption of the following three standards did not have a material
   impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

   In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU,
   No. 2009-13 "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements." This ASU
   establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements
   including multiple revenue-generating activities. This ASU provides
   amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables, measuring and
   allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of
   accounting. The amendments in this ASU also establish a selling price
   hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
   Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide
   information about a vendor's multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements,
   including information about the nature and terms, significant
   deliverables and its performance within arrangements. The amendments
   also required providing information about the significant judgments
   made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of
   the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of
   revenue recognition. The amendments in this ASU are effective
   prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially
   modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We
   adopted this standard on January 1, 2011.

   In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, "Certain Revenue
   Arrangements That Include Software Elements." This ASU changes the
   accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible
   products and software elements that are "essential to the
   functionality," and scopes these products out of current software
   revenue guidance. The new guidance will include factors to help
   companies determine what software elements are considered "essential to
   the functionality." The amendments will now subject software-enabled
   products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as
   guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple-deliverables.
   The amendments in this ASU are effective prospectively for revenue
   arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years
   beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We adopted this standard on
   January 1, 2011.

   In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, "Milestone Method of
   Revenue Recognition," which indicates the criteria that should be met
   for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition
   is appropriate. Companies can recognize consideration that is
   contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue
   in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone
   meets all criteria to be considered substantive. This ASU was effective
   for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We adopted this
   standard on January 1, 2011.






   22
     __________________________________________________________________



   The accounting standards described below will be effective in future
   reporting periods and are not yet adopted.

   In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, "Intangibles -
   Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Testing Goodwill for Impairment," which
   permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is
   more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than
   its carrying value before applying the two-step goodwill impairment
   model that is currently in place. If it is determined through the
   qualitative assessment that a reporting unit's fair value is more
   likely than not greater than its carrying value, the remaining
   impairment steps would be unnecessary. The qualitative assessment is
   optional, allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative
   assessment. This update is effective for annual and interim goodwill
   impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
   2011, but early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this standard
   for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 and do not expect the
   standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
   statements.

   In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income
   (Topic 220)--Presentation of Comprehensive Income" which requires an
   entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of
   net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in
   a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two
   separate but consecutive statements. This accounting standard update
   eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive
   income as part of the statement of equity and is effective for fiscal
   years beginning after December 15, 2011.  The FASB has announced that
   certain aspects of this update may be delayed; however as issued in
   June 2011, this accounting standard update is not expected to have a
   significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we do
   not currently have any items recorded in other comprehensive income.

   In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve
   Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
   and International Financial Reporting Standards", which provides a
   consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value
   measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP
   and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes
   certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure
   requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU
   2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
   December 15, 2011.  ASU 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual
   periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We believe there will be no
   significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result
   of adopting ASU 2011-04.



   In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to clarify the
   acquisition date that should be used for reporting pro-forma financial
   information for business combinations. If comparative financial
   statements are presented, the pro-forma revenue and earnings of the
   combined entity for the comparable prior reporting period should be
   reported as though the acquisition date for all business combinations
   that occurred during the current year had been completed as of the
   beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The
   amendments in this guidance are effective prospectively for business
   combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1,
   2011. There will be no impact in the consolidated financial results as
   the amendments relate only to additional disclosures.

   In December 2010, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on
   goodwill impairment testing. The amendments modify Step 1 of the
   goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative
   carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to
   perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely
   than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In making that
   determination, the guidance states that an entity should consider
   whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an
   impairment may exist. The amendments are effective for fiscal years and
   interim periods beginning January 1, 2011 and are not expected to have
   a significant impact in the consolidated financial statements.

   Item 3.                                Quantitative and Qualitative
   Disclosures About Market Risk

   Our principal market risk relates to interest rate sensitivity, which
   is the risk that future changes in interest rates will reduce our net
   income or net assets. There have been no material changes in our
   principal market risk exposures from the information disclosed in our
   annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.

   In addition, we receive processing fees paid from our bank partner,
   based on prevailing interest rates and the total deposits held in our
   OneAccounts. Since 2008, fees paid by our bank partner have been
   relatively small because of historically low interest rates. A change
   in interest rates would affect the amount of processing fees that we
   earn and therefore would have an effect on our revenue, cash flows and
   results of operations.






   23
     __________________________________________________________________





   Item 4.                          Controls and Procedures

   Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
   and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
   disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
   15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
   Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2011. Based on this evaluation, our
   Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
   of September 30, 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures were
   effective to provide reasonable assurance that information is
   accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
   Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
   timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and ensure that
   information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit
   under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
   within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

   There has been no change in our internal controls over financial
   reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 identified in
   connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d)
   of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this
   report that has materially affected, or is reasonable likely to
   materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

                         PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

   Item 1.                                Legal Proceedings

   On June 22, 2010, Higher One, Inc., or HOI, provided notice and a
   certificate of claim for indemnity under the Stock Purchase Agreement
   by and among HOI and the former stockholders of Informed Decisions
   Corporation, or IDC, dated November 19, 2009, arising from certain
   misrepresentations and breaches of warranty. At the same time, we
   deposited $8.25 million, equal to the remaining balance of the
   post-closing payments, with an escrow agent.  Separately, the former
   stockholders of IDC filed a complaint against HOI in the United States
   District Court for the Northern District of California, or the
   Complaint, on July 20, 2010, disputing that misrepresentations were
   made and that warranties were breached; alleging breach of contract and
   anticipatory breach; and seeking a declaratory judgment ordering that
   the post-closing payments be made in accordance with the schedule set
   forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

   On April 25, 2011, HOI and the former stockholders of IDC agreed to a
   settlement, the material terms of which are as follows: (a) $2 million
   of the amount held in escrow, plus pro-rated interest, was to be paid
   to HOI; (b) $6.25 million of the amount held in escrow, plus pro-rated
   interest, was to be paid to the former stockholders; and (c) HOI and
   the former stockholders generally and mutually released each other from
   all past and future claims, known and unknown, arising out of the stock
   purchase agreement and related transition services agreements between
   HOI and each of the former stockholders, relating to the operation or
   sale of IDC, including all indemnification and payment obligations,
   with the exception of certain rights, obligations and claims.  The
   amount held in escrow was distributed to HOI and the former
   stockholders of IDC in accordance with the terms of the settlement
   agreement in May 2011.

   We recorded the impact of the settlement agreement in the quarter
   ending June 30, 2011.  The $2 million returned from escrow to us was
   recorded as other income of $1.5 million, reflecting a payment made
   under the indemnification provisions of the stock purchase agreement
   and a reduction of general and administrative expenses of $0.5 million,
   reflecting the recovery of certain legal costs incurred for the
   litigation.

   Except as described above, there have been no material developments in
   our legal proceedings since we filed our annual report on Form 10-K for
   the year ended December 31, 2010.






   24
     __________________________________________________________________



    Item 1A.                      Risk Factors

    There have been no material changes to our risk factors from those
   disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
   31, 2010, except as follows:

   Reviews and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities under banking
   and consumer protection laws and regulations may result in changes to
   our business practices or may expose us to the risk of fines,
   restitution and litigation.

   Our operations and the operations of our bank partner are subject to
   the jurisdiction and examination of federal, state and local regulatory
   authorities, including the FDIC, which is our bank partner's primary
   federal regulator. Our business practices, including the terms of our
   products, are reviewed and approved by our banking partner and subject
   to both periodic and special reviews by such regulatory authorities,
   which can range from investigations into specific consumer complaints
   or concerns to broader inquiries into our practices generally. We and
   our bank partner are subject to ongoing and routine examination by the
   FDIC. If, as part of an examination or review, the regulatory
   authorities conclude that we are not complying with applicable laws or
   regulations, they could request or impose a wide range of remedies,
   including, but not limited to, requiring changes to the terms of our
   products (such as decreases in fees), the imposition of fines or
   penalties or the institution of enforcement proceedings or other
   similar actions against us alleging that our practices constitute
   unfair or deceptive acts or practices. As part of an enforcement
   action, the regulators can seek restitution for affected customers and
   impose civil money penalties. In addition, negative publicity relating
   to any specific inquiry or investigation or any related fine could
   adversely affect our stock price; our relationships with various
   industry participants; or our ability to attract new and retain
   existing clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition and results of operations.

   Following a recently conducted compliance examination, the New York
   Regional Office of the FDIC notified us that it was prepared to
   recommend to the Director of FDIC Supervision that an enforcement
   action be taken against us for alleged violations of certain applicable
   laws and regulations principally relating to our compliance management
   system and policies and practices for past overdraft charging on
   persistently delinquent accounts, collections and transaction error
   resolution. Any such enforcement action could result in an order to pay
   restitution and civil money penalties. We have responded to the FDIC's
   notification, but the process is ongoing and there can be no assurances
   as to the outcome of this process. An action instituted against us that
   results in significant changes to our practices, the imposition on us
   of fines or penalties, or an obligation for us to pay restitution or
   civil money penalties could have a material adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition and results of operations.

   Fees for financial services are subject to increasingly intense
   legislative and regulatory scrutiny, which could have a material
   adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
   operations and prospects for future growth.

   In 2010, 2009 and 2008, approximately 78%, 88% and 85% of our revenue
   was generated from interchange fees, ATM fees, non-sufficient funds
   fees, other banking services fees and convenience fees. These fees, as
   well as the financial services industry in general, have undergone or
   may undergo substantial changes in the near future. These changes could
   have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
   results of operations and prospects for future growth.

   Effective July 1, 2010, the Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation E
   to limit the ability of financial institutions to assess an overdraft
   fee for paying ATM and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw a
   consumer's account, unless the consumer affirmatively consents, or opts
   in, to the institution's payment of overdrafts for these services. In
   the absence of such a consent, a financial institution may not assess
   an overdraft fee on a consumer for an ATM or one-time debit card
   transaction.

   On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
   Protection Act, or the Act, was signed into law. The Act increases the
   already substantial regulation and oversight of the financial services
   industry and imposes restrictions on the ability of firms within the
   industry, including us, to conduct business consistent with historical
   practices. For example, under the Act, a Consumer Financial Protection
   Bureau, or the Bureau, has been established to regulate any person
   engaged in a "financial activity" in connection with a consumer
   financial product or service, including those, such as us, that process
   financial services products and services. The Bureau has assumed
   regulatory authority for many of the laws to which we and our partner
   bank, The Bancorp Bank, are subject and may have direct supervisory
   authority over us.  The Bureau also will have authority to issue and
   enforce regulations relating to consumer financial protection designed
   to prevent unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices in the offering of
   consumer financial products.


   25
     __________________________________________________________________



   The Act also requires changes to be made to the manner in which
   merchants accept and process certain debit- and credit-card
   transactions. Specifically, the Act, subject to certain exemptions,
   requires the Federal Reserve to impose limits on debit card interchange
   fees tied to the cost of processing the transaction, which may have the
   result of decreasing revenue to debit card issuers and processors. On
   June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued its final rule
   implementing these limits on debit card interchange fees that, among
   other things would limit interchange fees on debit card transactions to
   a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the
   transaction amount, and up to an additional 1 cent to cover investments
   in fraud prevention measures.  At the same time, the Federal Reserve
   approved an interim final rule that allows for an upward adjustment of
   no more than 1 cent to an issuer's debit card interchange fee if the
   issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably
   designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set out in the
   interim final rule.  These limits became effective October 1, 2011.  In
   accordance with the Act, issuers that, together with their affiliates,
   have less than $10 billion in assets are exempt from the debit card
   interchange fee standards, although they are subject to the
   prohibitions on network exclusivity and routing restrictions.
   Nevertheless, it is anticipated that smaller issuers, such as The
   Bancorp Bank, may also be impacted. Some federal, state, and local
   government-administered payment programs that use debit cards are
   exempt from this interchange fee restriction. Additionally, the Act
   permits merchants to offer a discount or other incentive to encourage
   use of one form of payment over another. Furthermore, the Act, as
   implemented by the Federal Reserve Board's final rule, prohibits an
   issuer or payment card network from restricting the number of payment
   card networks over which an electronic debit transaction may be
   processed to fewer than two unaffiliated networks, or restricting the
   ability of a merchant to direct the routing of electronic debit
   transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to
   process the electronic debit transactions. The Act also allows
   merchants to set minimum purchase thresholds for credit card
   transactions, provided such thresholds do not exceed $10, and it
   permits institutions of higher education and federal agencies - which
   constitute many of our clients - to impose maximum dollar amounts for
   credit-card purchases. Individual state legislatures are also reviewing
   interchange fees, and legislators in a number of states have proposed
   bills that purport to limit interchange fees or merchant discount rates
   or to prohibit their application to portions of a transaction.

   The scope and impact of many of the Act's provisions, including those
   summarized above, will continue to be determined through the rule
   making process. As a result, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of
   the Act on us or The Bancorp Bank at this time, nor can we predict the
   impact or substance of other future legislation or regulation. However,
   we believe that the Act, other recent changes in regulation, including
   the Regulation E changes summarized above, and legislation under
   consideration by the states, could affect how we and our bank partner
   operate by significantly reducing the interchange fees, ATM fees,
   non-sufficient fund fees, other banking services fees and convenience
   fees charged in respect of our services and that drive our financial
   results. These regulatory and legislative changes could also increase
   our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes or
   limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient
   manner. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially and
   adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
   operations.

   We rely on our bank partner for certain banking services, and a change
   in relationship with our bank partner or its failure to comply with
   certain banking regulations could materially and adversely affect our
   business.

   As the provider of FDIC-insured depository services for all of our
   OneAccounts, as well as other banking functions, such as supplying cash
   for our ATM machines, The Bancorp Bank, our bank partner, provides
   third-party services that are critical to our student-oriented banking
   services. On August 8, 2011, The Bancorp Bank provided us a notice of
   termination of our services agreement that included a termination
   effective date of not later than May 4, 2012, or 270 days after the
   date of the termination notice. Upon termination of the services
   agreement, The Bancorp Bank is obligated to transfer the deposits and
   any related bank identification numbers, routing numbers and other
   related identifiers used by us in connection with the deposits of our
   customers and deliver any and all applicable information, account
   opening contracts and related items.

   If any material adverse event were to affect The Bancorp Bank, or any
   future bank partner, including, but not limited to, a significant
   decline in its financial condition, a decline in the quality of its
   service, loss of deposits, its inability to comply with applicable
   banking and financial service regulatory requirements, systems failure
   or its inability to pay us fees, our business, financial condition and
   results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we
   change banking partners, we may not be successful in such change.  In
   addition, there is a risk that the terms of our services agreement with
   a new banking partner may not be as favorable to us.  If we are unable
   to change banking partners prior to the termination effective date of
   our agreement with The Bancorp Bank, we may not be able to extend the
   current relationship with The Bancorp Bank or otherwise be able to
   continue to offer the OneAccount in the same manner as we do now.  The
   aggregate impact could have a material adverse effect on our business,
   financial condition and results of operations.
